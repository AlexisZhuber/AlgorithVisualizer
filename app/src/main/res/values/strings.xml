        What is Bubble Sort?

        Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly comparing
        adjacent elements in a list and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

        Imagine you have a row of numbers and you want to sort them from smallest to largest.
        Bubble Sort will look at the first two numbers, swap them if needed, then move on
        to the next pair, and so on. With each pass, the largest unsorted number "bubbles"
        up to its correct position.

        Here is an example in Kotlin:

        fun bubbleSort(arr: MutableList<Int>) {
            for (i in 0 until arr.size) {
                for (j in 0 until arr.size - i - 1) {
                    if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                        val temp = arr[j]
                        arr[j] = arr[j + 1]
                        arr[j + 1] = temp
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        In this visualizer, each bar represents a number. The numbers are displayed on the bars,
        and the two bars being compared are highlighted in a different color.

        Enjoy learning and have fun with Bubble Sort!
